This guide walks you through installing the 909Dimensions vertical stand for the Lian Li Dan A4-H2O case. The vertical stand elevates your PC and gives it a compact footprint.

> A downloadable PDF version of the official installation guide is available [here](/static/documents/909Dimensions_LianLiDanA4H2OVerticalStand_InstallationGuide.pdf).

## Before You Begin

### Parts Included

- Vertical stand base
- Hardware kit (screws, washers, etc.)

### Tools Required

- Allen key (2.5mm)
- Phillips head screwdriver (Optional)
- Clean, flat work surface

### Preparation

1. Power down your PC completely and unplug all cables.
2. Clear a workspace with enough room to lay the case on its front.
3. Handle with care.

## Installation Steps

### Step 0: Position the case

Lay the case flat on the front panel, giving you unrestricted access to the rear IO section.

### Step 1: Remove original thumbscrews if installed

If you don't have the original thumbscrews installed, you can skip this step.

### Step 2: Align the vertical stand with the holes for the thumbscrews

Ensure that the arch opening of the vertical stand is pointing towards the bottom of the case. This is not only so you can route the cables out the back of the case, but the holes are indeed seperated distances from the edge of the case.

### Step 3: Use the provided screws to secure the vertical stand to the case

These will screw directly into the same holes as the original thumbscrew holes.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| Stand feels wobbly | Check that all screws are tight and the base is on a flat surface. |
| Case doesn't align with bracket | Verify you have the correct orientation for the vertical stand. |
| Screws won't thread | Some force may be required to thread the screws into the case, but do not overtighten. |
