import Card from "@/components/Card.astro"

Most of what I do lives somewhere between backend logic and making frontends not suck. I like figuring things out, building little tools, and getting stuff to actually work for people (and not just in theory).

This blog is my dumping ground for side projects, code stuff I've learned the hard way, and ideas that might be useful â€” or just fun. Think of it as part dev journal, part playground. If you're into scrappy builds, real talk, and behind-the-scenes dev stuff, you're in the right place.

      "It's simple, focused, and built for people who want automation without losing control. We're iterating fast - click the link below to join the beta waitlist."
