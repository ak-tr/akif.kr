Back End Developer turned Full Stack: I began my career working as a Back End Developer using Node.js and Typescript to build, integrate and consume a wide range of APIs using an array of technologies. 

Now I am working on developing and delivering internal tools using Vue and Typescript to help increase productivity within the team by providing fast, responsive and easy to use tools.

I have mainly been focusing on using Firebase as our development platform which has opened up opportunities to learn and implement other Google Cloud products such as queues using Cloud Task, asynchronous messaging using Pub/Sub and functions using Cloud Run and Eventarc.

I am intrigued by all things tech which is why I have created this website to create posts of projects, ideas, findings and more that I think are worthy of sharing and that may help others.
