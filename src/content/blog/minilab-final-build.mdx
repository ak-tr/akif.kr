So for those of who might've read my [previous post](/blog/my-mini-home-server-build-3d-printed-modt-nas) regarding my home server build, I mentioned that I was going to be migrating to something new shortly after. Well, I finally did that (after months of ordering parts, waiting and building) and here are the results.

## Introduction

<PostImage src="/static/images/minilab-final-build/ml_diagram.jpg" alt="MiniLab diagram" subtitle="Diagram of the MiniLab build" />

Since I built my last mini home server in the Beamcase SFF, I fell in love with the idea of custom cases built around aluminium extrusions. I decide to use my newfound love for extrusions to build my very own homelab (minilab).

## The Chassis

I really liked the small footprint of the 1515 extrusions that Beamcase used, but I felt like that might not be enough for the amount of weight that this case would be carrying. For that reason, I decided to opt for 2020 extrusions instead. To maintain full transparency for this post, I will mention all the exact dimensions where possible along with the pricing.

I ordered the extrusions from a UK based company, Ooznest. The parts list is as follows:

| Part                             | Quantity | Price (GBP) |
|----------------------------------|----------|-------------|
| 2020 Aluminium Extrusion (405mm) | 4        | £16.88      |
| 2020 Aluminium Extrusion (254mm) | 8        | £22.76      |

In order to make this an official 10 inch rack, I also needed to order some rack rails. This was originally going to be an 8U tall build, so I ordered 8U rack strip from Penn Elcom. I decided I had space for 9U due to the height of my rails, so I later ordered another set of 9U rack strips. The parts list is as follows:

| Part                             | Quantity | Price (GBP) |
|----------------------------------|----------|-------------|
| 8U Rack Strip                    | 2        | £5.16       |
| 9U Rack Strip                    | 2        | £5.68       |

I later realised after I ordered that although the 254mm in width would be enough for a 10 inch rack (25.4cm) I had to still account for the thickness of the rails. The rails themselves are 2mm, so an additional 4mm was needed. I printed these in the form of shims which attach to the 3D printed corner brackets.

## The Parts

Now if I cover every single part in this list, it might be a bit overwhelming. So I'll just cover the most important parts and the ones that I think are worth mentioning.

I'll start off by going from bottom to top on the build.

### JBOD

<PostImage src="/static/images/minilab-final-build/ml_drives.jpg" alt="MiniLab drives" subtitle="Drives installed in the MiniLab" />

This minilab consists of 4x 2TB disks. If you have read my previous post, you will know these are Constellation ES.3 drives. To keep costs down, I bought these second hand off of eBay. As they are SAS drives, they were relatively cheap. Including the caddies, it came to to a total of £47.19 with discount codes applied.

### The Main Server

Just like my previous post, this is the same Minisforum BD795i SE system I used as my main server. This is running the bulk of my VMs/LXCs including a virtualised instance of TrueNAS.

Without diving too deep into the specs, this is a Ryzen 9 7945HX CPU (16C/32T) with 32GB DDR5 memory. What it differs to my previous setup is that it now uses a 450W modular Flex ATX PSU. Although my previous PSU was way more powerful, it was non-modular which made cable management a bit of a pain. The previous 600W PSU was also a bit overkill for this setup.

### The Router

<PostImage src="/static/images/minilab-final-build/ml_m720q_open.jpg" alt="MiniLab router" subtitle="Open shot of the M720Q machine prior to installing Intel X520-DA2" />

I was fed up of using ISP-provided routers as they are painfully slow, and lack many good features that I'd like to take advantage of. I opted for an M720Q which I bought second hand off of eBay for just under £100. This one boasts a 6C/6T i5-8500T with 16GB of DDR4 memory. I also bought a second hand Intel X520-DA2 which I installed in the machine. This gave my system 2x SFP ports which I use to connect to the switch.

For the software, this system is also running Proxmox with just OPNsense for now. 

### The Managed Switch

With the new capabilities software like OPNsense, I wanted to run VLANs within my network. Now managed switches can get pretty expensive and although no-name Chinese switches are probably not the way, this one has yet to let me down during my time using it.

For the switch I went for YuanLey's YS25-0402M managed switch. I bought it for around £37.79 new which is a steal for a switch with this capability, it seems to be going for around £60 now. This is a 4 port 2.5G switch with an additional 2x SFP+ ports.

The first of the 2.5G ports is used to connect to the server - trunk port connecting VLANs 20, 30, and 99. The next 2 2.5G ports are used to connect to my Zyxel NWA50BE wireless access points. These are connected using wired backhaul - one downstairs to provide coverage for ground floor, and one upstairs to provide coverage for the bedrooms/office. The 4th port is used as a management port giving access to both Proxmox hosts, no other access other than from this port. The 5th port (SFP+) is used to connect to the unmanaged switch above (VLAN 10) and the 6th port (also SFP+) is used to connect to the X520-DA2 (LAN) on the M720Q machine.

### Patch Panel

This is quite self-explanatory. It is a 3D printed patch panel which uses ethernet keystone couplers. A lot of these ports connected to a patch panel on the back of the case to keep everything tidy. The first port goes straight down to the main server.

### The Unmanaged Switch

This is a cheap 8 2.5G port switch with an additional SFP+ port. These are for all the devices around the house i.e. PCs, Apple TV, camera etc. They all live on VLAN 10. As this is an unmanaged switch, they all go to the router via the SFP+ port. Surprisingly, this switch was actually more expensive than the managed switch at £45.99.

### The Other Stuff

I had a free 1U slot at the top so decided to custom model a 1U mount for my 2 spare Raspbery Pi Zero's, one of which will be running some custom code to output VM/LXC status to a Blinkt! module. There is also a travel router on there to act as a backup uplink. Finally, a Raspberry Pi 4B is running docker with containers for things that don't require as much juice as the main server.

## Things to Note

Here are a few things that I believe are noteworthy enough to mention in this post.

### Cooling the Drives

<PostImage src="/static/images/minilab-final-build/ml_complete_left.jpg" alt="MiniLab left" subtitle="Left shot of the MiniLab assembled" />

The 3D printed parts that house the drives are quite tightly packed and as a result meant they got quite hot. Exceeding 50C in some cases. This was mitigated by using a fan to cool the drives. The fan I used was a spare Arctic P12 Pro from my previous build.

### Powering the switches

Both switches came with their own 12V 1A plugs. Due to the size of the build, it wasn't feasible to power the switches each from their own power supply and since the Flex ATX PSU I am using exposes a 12V rail with more than enough current to power these things, I decided to power them from the PSU. I did this by using a GPU 8 pin to 2x 5525 barrel connectors. These were sourced cheaply from AliExpress. The only caveat is that if the main server is powered off, so are the switches, but as I'm looking for maximal uptime in this build, it shouldn't be a problem.

Over time, I'm sure there will be more to add to this, but for now, this is what I have and what I feel is worth documenting. For reference, here is a link to the Reddit post for this build: [r/minilab - Finally finished the minilab](https://www.reddit.com/r/minilab/comments/1psyq9m/finally_finished_the_minilab/).

## Looking to Build Your Own 10-Inch Rack?

If you're inspired by this build and looking to create your own 10-inch rack setup, I run an Etsy store called [909 Dimensions](https://909dimensions.etsy.com) where I sell 3D printed 10-inch rack equipment. The product range is continuously growing, so check it out if you're in the market for quality 3D printed rack components.
